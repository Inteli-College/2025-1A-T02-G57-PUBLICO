## Cost Classification

### Direct Fixed Costs

- **Premium Hosting**: R$ 38.99/month (viafacilis.com.br)
- **.COM.BR Domain**: R$ 4.99/month
- **Pro-labore (2x)**: R$ 3,600.00/month (founders' remuneration)
- **CLT Employee**: R$ 2,756.33/month (salary R$ 1,800.00 + legal charges)

### Indirect Costs

- **Marketing and User Acquisition (CAC)**
- **Commercial Prospecting in New Regions**
- **Specialist Consultancies and Module Validation**
- **Team Training and Technical Capacity Building**

These costs are related to growth, market validation, and ongoing formation.

### Direct Variable Costs

- **Google Cloud Firestore**: Based on usage — estimated at R$ 18.18 for 1,000 users with 3GB/month usage.
- **ISS (Service Tax)**: 2% on monthly gross revenue. Proportional to the number of paying users.

## Break-even Point

To cover the estimated monthly fixed costs (R$ 18,647.09), considering a net average ticket of R$ 89.90, the break-even point can be calculated as follows:

Break-even Point = Fixed Cost / Net Average Ticket 
Net Average Ticket = 89.90 * 0.98 (Discounting ISS) → 88.102 
Break-even Point ≈ R$ 18,647.09 / R$ 88.102 ≈ 211.6 → 212 users

Thus, the project reaches break-even with 212 active paying users.

## Economies of Scale

The modular structure of the platform allows for the dilution of fixed costs as the user base grows. Resources such as marketing, sales, and technical support exhibit efficiency gains proportional to the increase in client volume.

## Scalability Projections

This section details the expected evolution of costs as the user base grows. Estimates consider the expansion of reach, increased marketing and support infrastructure, and proportional growth in the use of cloud resources (Google Cloud Firestore).

| Scenario                 | Users  | Firestore (R$) | Technical Support (R$) | Marketing (R$) | Salespersons (CLT)     | Estimated Total Monthly |
|--------------------------|--------|----------------|------------------------|----------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Moderate Expansion**   | 3,000  | R$ 54.54       | R$ 2,000.00            | R$ 12,000.00   | 1 (R$ 2,734.91)        | R$ 22,683.09            |
| **Rapid Growth**         | 10,000 | R$ 181.80      | R$ 4,000.00            | R$ 18,000.00   | 3 (R$ 8,204.73)        | R$ 34,280.17            |

> The growth of the user base contributes to the dilution of fixed costs per customer, increasing operational efficiency. However, this progress also requires greater investment in technical support and infrastructure. As revenue expands, there is room for more aggressive marketing and sales strategies, further driving the growth cycle.

**Firestore:** estimated based on R$ 0.01818 per user/month (3GB/month). Total cost = users × R$ 0.01818.

**Technical Support:** increases proportionally to the volume of users and operation complexity.

**Salespersons (CLT):** estimated at R$ 2,734.91 per salesperson.

## Conclusion

The proposed cost structure demonstrates that the business model is financially sustainable from its early stages, with an accessible and well-defined break-even point. As the user base grows, fixed costs quickly dilute, providing a significant margin and operational efficiency boost.

The model also benefits from a lean operation based on technology and automation, significantly reducing reliance on direct labor. Even in scenarios of rapid growth, personnel costs evolve in a controlled and proportional manner, without compromising the scalability of the business. More details on the strategic rationale can be found in the [business model document](./modelo_negocio.md).
