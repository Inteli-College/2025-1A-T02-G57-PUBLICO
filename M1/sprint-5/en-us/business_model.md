# Business Model

## Introduction
This document compiles the studies conducted so far, structuring them into a business model aimed at micro and small entrepreneurs (MEIs and MEs). The goal is to present, in a strategic way, how the solution can evolve into a profitable and scalable operation, serving as a foundation for future validations and guiding the next development cycles.

## Business Model Canvas

To facilitate the visualization of the business model, I used the Business Model Canvas, a strategic tool widely adopted by entrepreneurs to describe, plan, and validate business models.

The canvas consists of nine key blocks — such as value proposition, customer segments, channels, revenue streams, and cost structure — allowing a summarized understanding of the operation, as well as helping to identify opportunities.

### Customer Segment
Entrepreneurs aged 24 to 45, registered as **MEI** or **ME**, interested in **expanding their businesses**.  
Potential market with more than **14 million companies**, growing at a rate of **2.8 million per year**, although **20% close in the first year**.

## Conclusion
The analysis of this business model, combined with the cost structure and break-even point definition, points to a financially viable, scalable proposal aligned with the real needs of micro and small entrepreneurs identified in [sprint 1](../../README.md). Throughout the structuring, we sought to start from a concrete base — the high mortality rate of these businesses — to develop a solution that goes beyond offering a system, proposing a supportive ecosystem.

Based on initial estimates, the break-even point is reached with approximately 212 active paying users, demonstrating medium-term sustainability potential. The acquisition strategies outlined — such as local prospecting, referral programs, and content marketing — were defined considering both execution capacity and the [persona's](../../sprint-3/pt-br/persona.md) digital access reality. Additionally, the modular structure of the system outlined in [sprint 4](../../sprint-4/README.md) ensures flexibility in adoption, allowing users to grow within the same platform.

During the development of this model, we ensured alignment with the target audience's profile, prioritizing the mitigation of [systemic challenges](../../README.md/#problemática) that threaten business sustainability. The proposal represents, therefore, a synthesis between market opportunity, technical capacity, and an impact thesis with potential for return.

The next step will be to validate all these hypotheses through research with the audience and tests with real users. This process will allow us to fine-tune the product, adjust the strategy, and refine the elements of the model to ensure they remain consistent with market reality.
