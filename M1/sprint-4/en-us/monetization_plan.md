# Monetization Plan  

## Introduction  
This monetization plan was developed based on the functional interrelations described in the [**Solution Diagram**](/sprint-4/diagrama_solucoes.md), which organizes the platform into three independent domains (**POS**, **Finance**, and **Customers**) with critical dependencies and connections between their tools.  

The modular structure of the domains, combined with the hierarchy of primary/secondary tools and cross-connections (e.g., Sales Record → Cash Flow), enables the creation of scalable plans that support the progressive growth of a micro-entrepreneur, from the initial phase to operational maturity.

## Monetization Logic Based on Dependencies  

### 1. **Upselling Through Cross-Domain Connections**  
- **Example 1:** The connection **Coupon Registration (Customers) → Sales Record (POS)** is only available in the **Integrated/Premium** plans, as it promotes increased sales through promotions.  
- **Example 2:** The dependency **Product Report → Cash Flow** requires the **Integrated** plan, justified by the need for advanced financial analysis.  

### 2. **Monetization of Secondary Tools**  
- **Reports (Income Statement, Cash Report):** Available only in paid plans, emphasizing "strategic financial control."  
- **Automations**: Exclusive panel that leverages data produced by the domains to create custom automations based on this information. (E.g., **Cash Flow** indicator controls the percentage of coupons in **Loyalty Management**) **Premium**.

## Engagement Promotions  
- **14-Day Free Trial:** Access to connected features (e.g., **Sales Record → Loyalty Management**).  
- **Premium Referral:** 1 free month of the **Integrated** plan for each successful referral.

## Conclusion  
This plan utilizes the modular architecture of the **Solution Diagram** to provide a clear growth path:  

1. **Free Plan:** Attracts beginner micro-entrepreneurs, limited to one domain (e.g., POS for those focused on sales).  
2. **Paid Plans:** Unlock cross-domain connections (e.g., Finance + POS), aligned with the needs of expanding businesses.  
3. **Premium Features:** Monetize secondary tools and automations, crucial for operational scaling.  

The dependency structure (e.g., **Group Registration → Product Registration → Sales Record**) ensures a natural progression between plans, while cross-connections (e.g., **Coupons → Sales → Loyalty**) create perceived value, encouraging upgrades.
