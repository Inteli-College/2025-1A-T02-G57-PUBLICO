# High-Fidelity Prototype

## Introduction

The high-fidelity prototype developed for the POS system aims to provide an intuitive and efficient interface for small entrepreneurs. The visual organization and design choices were made to optimize navigation and make essential functionalities easily accessible. This document details the key aspects of the design, including structure, color palette, and usability guidelines.

## Interface Structure

The interface is divided into two main areas:

- **Sidebar:** Intended for quick access to the system's main sections, enabling intuitive navigation.
- **Main Area:** Where essential actions are performed, presented clearly and accessibly.

The POS functionalities are organized into large cards, each containing an icon and a brief description. This approach facilitates function identification and improves usability over time.

## Color Palette

The color selection was made to ensure adequate contrast and facilitate readability:

- **Text:**  
  - Primary Color: #252525  
  - Secondary Color: #424242  

- **Background:**  
  - Primary Color: #FCFFF7  
  - Secondary Color: #F0F2F5  
  - Tertiary Color: #E5E6E9  

- **Other Colors:**  
  - Action: #475569  
  - Attention: #FF7070  

## Usability Guidelines

Several important points were considered to ensure an efficient user experience:

- The data tables will have a fixed size and, as they are filled, will adopt a scrolling behavior to maintain usability.
- The profit display component will automatically update once the cost and price fields are filled.
- Temporal filters will default to the current month, considering the routine of small entrepreneurs.
- Visual separation of information was made based on context, making navigation more fluid and intuitive.
- The delivery fee will be set based on the region, with a default value of R$3.00 for small towns in Paran√°.

## Conclusion

With the careful attention to design and organization of the interface, it is expected that the system will pass future usability tests as an intuitive and user-friendly solution for users.
