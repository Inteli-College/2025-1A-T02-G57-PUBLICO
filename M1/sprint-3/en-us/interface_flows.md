# Interface Flow

## Introduction

This section presents the interface flows, correlating them with user stories.

### Tutorial
``` 
In this document, a flow visualization technology was added, integrated with the Figma service. To make the most of the experience, you need to be connected to the internet and access the flow presentations.

Once the screen is loaded, the flow will become interactive. You can click on areas of the content where clickable components will blink in blue, or if you prefer, navigate using the arrows on your keyboard, like in a slide presentation.
```
